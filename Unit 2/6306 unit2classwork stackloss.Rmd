# Introduction
This R markdown gives the code and output for a function to return the mean of the pollutant across all monitors listed in the 'id' vector (ignoring NA values)

#Specifications
  * 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating the location of the CSV files (the current working directory)
  * 'pollutant' is a character vector of length 1 indicating the name of the pollutant for which we will calculate the mean; either "sulfate" or "nitrate".
  * 'id' is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID numbers to be used
# Important
This data resides in the directory 
"c:ljhk;asdf;ljkasf;ljkadsf"

```{r}
setwd("c:ljhk;asdf;ljkasf;ljkadsf")
source("pollutantmean.R")
pollutantmean <- function(directory,pollutant, id=1:332{
  
  fnames <- list.files()
  dat <- data.frame()
  for (i in id) {
    dat <- rbind(dat, read.csv(fnames[i]))
  }
}
)
###change WD to specta directory
setwd(paste(getwd(),"/specdata",sep=""))
nitrate.mean <-pollutantmean(directory=getwd(),pollutant="nitrate")
```

The mean nitrate content for these stations is

```{r}
nitrate.mean
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
